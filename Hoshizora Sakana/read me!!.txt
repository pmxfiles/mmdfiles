Hi~! x3
Thanks for downloading my model base!!

I have a few conditions on you using this model:
-No editing or taking parts, even though I made
 them from 3DCG i fixed its physics and edited textures
 plus some editing to this model after its conversion.
-Don't say you made it. Because you didnt.
-Dont redistribute it. If someone wants it refer them to the dA art link.

AND REMEMBER CREDIT TRINITYRAVEN@DA

!!IF ANY OF THESE ARE ABUSED I WILL LOCK IT AND ONLY GIVE OUT TO PEOPLE I TRUST!!
