(MikuMikuDance is a tool for creating 3DCG animations. It was developed and released to the public by Higuchi Yu.)

--About Crimrose--
Crimrose has traveled long and far from the Cosmic Ark on a journey to learn the meaning of the word "moe". Now she's arrived at a dimension near you! What kind of school life hijinks could be awaiting you and Crimrose?

--About the Model Data--
Designed to work with the physics engine of MikuMikuDance v7.39 and later. Some aspects of the model may behave strangely in versions earlier than 7.39.
