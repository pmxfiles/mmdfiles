IBRS_OVA

IBRS was created from scratch using absolutly zero borrowed parts. I spent about 100 hours of work on her to even get a finished product for you to download so I ask please don't take credit for my hard work.

Version 2.0 includes improved shorts weighting and proportioned head tweaks.
Version 2.1 includes improved hair bangs weighting and eye bone placement.
