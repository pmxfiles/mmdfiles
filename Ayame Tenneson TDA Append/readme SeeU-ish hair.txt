Thanks for downloading this item!

Now, there's a few conditions about the use of this item.

- Editing is allowed.
- Redistributing of the edit is allowed only if credited. (Come on, its just a username =3=; its not that hard ^^;)

Now, there's one trick on this one.
Since I dont want this item to be massively overused, the .pmd file is EDIT LOCKED.

If you manage to take out the edit lock, feel free to edit the item.


Why do I do this? To avoid bad edits.
I want this item to be used on models that look good. :3


If you use this, please show me, I'd love to see what you do with it! 83



Any questions, feel free to ask me~
Take care!

P.S: No, I'm not telling you how to get rid of the edit lock. Thank you.
