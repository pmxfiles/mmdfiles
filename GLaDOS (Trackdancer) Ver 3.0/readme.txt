CUBE ver 3.1.0.pmx
- original model
- the Cube has basic physics to allow it to be "sat on"
- can be animated
- can be illuminated using Object Luminous
	- subset# 4
- has additional utility bones:
	- attachment bones (4) - for objects that will need to move with the Cube
	- dummy bones (6) - these are identical to the default dummy bones
	- terrain and skydome bones for attaching scenery
	- LCD bone controls the position of the VMDSpectrum display
	- Twirl controller at top of the Cube can be used to spin the Cube on the Y-axis 
	  without affecting the position of the VMD display
- VMDSpectrum Holographic style display screen,
	- position this as desired (default: hidden inside the Cube)
	- it can be made to appear using the LCD ON facial
	- the Bars OFF facial switches off the visability of the bars which may be desirable in some applications
	- the VMD display can be moved when working without adverse affects
	- uses Band1 ~ Band7 (recommended that you configure the VMD data to use 9 bands)

core ver 3.2.0.pmx
- this is GLaDOS' missing Morality core ... ;)
- original model - same as the ones on GLaDOS but this one is totally independent
- pupils will dilate using VMDSpectrum data or the blink facial
- can be illuminated using Object Luminous
	- subset# 1
- the BIG facial makes it grow big ... large ego perhaps?
- also has an attachment bone in case it needs to carry an object


STAGE SET UP

The stage is comprised of several pieces:
	- podium.pmx 
	- podium.x
	- main_chamber.x
	- front_wall.x

- podium.pmx and podium.x can be used interchangeably (they are the same model). 
  For some applications the pmx model is more useful. It also has additional accessory support bones.
- podium.pmx has basic physics which is useful if the model is relocated above its default location.
- the main_chamber.x model is the main background scenery for this set. It can be used by itself, but note that you
  will have to manually adjust the floor level.
- use the front_wall.x model only if needed. Primarily it functions as a view block.
- the ceiling has skylights, so use a skydome if you're going to aim the camera upwards. 
  (Works great with the GOD-RAY MME effect).
- it is recommended that you turn off cast shadows and set the background to black.
