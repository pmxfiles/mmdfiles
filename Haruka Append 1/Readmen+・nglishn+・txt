＜Development History＞
　This model, which is different from the Hatsune Miku 1052C-Re series Hakutorii created
  (including all the models from Ver.1.0 to Ver.1.5. Distribution ended on 2011/7/29),
  is a newly made model from scratch with the feature and style of the Nanoha1052 family.
  This is not an edited model. 

　The name of this model is "Hatsune Miku Nanoha HT", as shown on the title.

　The "Nanoha1052 feature and style" on this text is based on my personal impression.

＜Design＞
  This model is made with my personal impression on Racing Miku 2011, whose design and structure are open
