Hiya!
Here are some simple rules I ask of those that DL this model <3

Please do not redistribute this model in any way, I will never be taking my DL down,
so just link back to the DA page you got this model from please!
(I will be updating her regularly anyways most likely.)

Do not remove any parts from her for your personal use, I took alot of time piecing this all together.
Also, I could just distribute the remade part if really needed by others.

And last but not least, have fun with her <3 You may pair her with whoever you like, but don't make the pictures
or vids too gruesome T^T, I have a weak heart, and I love this model dearly :C.
