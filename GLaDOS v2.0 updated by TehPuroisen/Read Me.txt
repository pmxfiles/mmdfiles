==============================

Info:
GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) is a fictional character in the 2007 Valve Software video game Portal.
She is an artificially intelligent computer system in charge of operating the Aperture Science research facility, which is the setting of Portal.
While initially appearing as a voice to guide and aid the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious, making multiple attempts to kill the player-character.
She eventually is revealed to be insane, having killed the scientists who ran Aperture previously with a deadly neurotoxin despite the fact that they installed a morality core in her ("You can always ignore your conscience").
She also appears in the sequel, Portal 2, taking place hundreds of years after the player-character defeats GLaDOS and being placed back in the chamber.
