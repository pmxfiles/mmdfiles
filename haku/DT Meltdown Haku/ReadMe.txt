Rules:
Please don't edit her at all, if you really want the parts, they are going to be listed below!
Please don't redistribute, I mean, I AM putting a link without a pass up on my page, so if you really want, just link
back to the original deviation.
And lastly, please credit me!!! Even if you don't put my name in the description, put in the tags! I really like seeing
my work be used (no matter how stupidly XD), if you have made a model before, you know how gratifying it is to see your
work appreciated and respected in the community.
